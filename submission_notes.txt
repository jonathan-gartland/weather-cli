This document is for the submission of the sample app, simply a document to collect relevant thoughts
and notes relating to implementing this solution that don't belong in a README.md file.

I chose to do this with Typescript/Node after playing a bit with a Python stub and a Dart stub. I chose this tech stack
because I am most comfortable with it and I wanted to get this done quickly. There are wrapper libraries already available in the NPM ecosystem for the
OpenWeatherMap API that can be installed using a convenient package manager. I opted to use the library instead of writing
that part of the utility myself to simplify the task and testing burden and save time. Since the task was focused on integration tests
this seemed prudent, as I needed to test the integrations of the library with my client code as part of implementing the solution.

Given the instructions, I hard coded the country code "US" into the url for the API call to simplify the testing.

The tests themselves are written in Jest.

What I tested for validation and some rationalizations:

Knowing we were only concerned with the US, one of the simpler tests that provides value is testing the
response longitude and latitude and ensuring they are within the bounds of the US. Alaska and Hawaii being included in the range
adds a good portion of Canada and Mexico to the physical range, but since we already filter for just US cities, this is acceptable.

There are some negative tests for bad input, such as a city that doesn't exist or garbage input.

There are some tests that I started implementing, but realized are really out of scope for this task such as testing the rate limits.
It would be trivial to build out more robust comprehensive tests for this client if necessary.
